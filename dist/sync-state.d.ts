 * How many workspace generations this machine remembers having held.

 * The list is what makes a merge base provably common to both trees (see
 * `knownWorkspaceGenerations`), so this bound is the one place that guarantee
 * degrades: a peer more than this many generations behind us declares a base we
 * have forgotten, and the pull then finds no common generation and falls to
 * no-ancestor mode — a loud skip — rather than merging against a guess. That is
 * the safe direction to degrade in, and 50 (fifty workspace pushes or pulls on
 * THIS machine with no sync from that peer in between) is deep enough that
 * reaching it means the peer has effectively stopped syncing. It is bounded at
 * all because each entry is ~200 bytes of a file rewritten on every hub

/**
 * Record a workspace generation this machine's tree now reflects — pushed or

 *
 * A generation is a POINTER at a bundle on the hub, never a copy of the tree,
 * because every workspace payload is a full snapshot and the hub already stores
 * it.
 *
 * Three rules the callers depend on:
 *
 * - **Write it only for a generation this machine's tree actually reflects.**
 *   Recording a generation that was never applied (a skipped payload, say)
 *   would make the NEXT merge read "present in the ancestor, absent locally"
 *   as a deliberate local deletion, so files the user never received would be
 *   silently withheld rather than delivered.
 * - **The history matters, not just the head.** `lastWorkspace` alone answers
 *   "what does our tree look like now"; choosing a legal merge base needs "did
 *   we ever hold the generation the peer says it built on", which only the list
 *   can answer. Keeping the head alone is what let a pull merge against a
 *   generation one of the two trees had never held.
 * - `generation.pushedAt` dates the BUNDLE and is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY: it is the
 *   pushing machine's wall clock — the hub is a passive filesystem and stamps
 *   nothing — so it must never be compared with another machine's stamp to
 *   order two generations.
 *
 * Same v1/v2 discipline as `setThreadId`: the hub block (and with it
 * schemaVersion 2) appears only once hub data is first written.

/**
 * Every workspace generation this machine's tree has passed through, most
 * recent first.
 *
 * This is one half of the "common to both trees" test that a 3-way merge base
 * must pass. The other half is what the incoming bundle chain declares it
 * descends from (`manifest.workspace.basedOn`); the intersection is the set of
 * legal bases, and `hub/pull.ts`'s `chooseMergeAncestor` takes the newest of
 * them.
 *
 * No timestamp is involved in that decision, deliberately. `pushedAt` is the
 * pushing machine's clock, so ordering two machines' generations by it is
 * meaningless — and a machine whose clock ran fast could otherwise talk a peer
 * into merging against the peer's OWN newest generation, which is precisely the
 * shape that silently reverts the peer's work.
 *
 * `lastWorkspace` leads whenever it is not already the head, so a state file
 * written before the list existed — or hand-edited — still contributes it.
