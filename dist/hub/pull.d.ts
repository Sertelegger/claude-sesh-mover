/**
 * Pick which of a thread's local sessions a continuation should splice onto.
 *
 * A thread maps to MORE THAN ONE local session as a matter of course: every
 * time a splice is declined (a live-looking base, a chain that doesn't line
 * up, `--no-append`) the fragment import mints a new session and maps it onto
 * the same thread, while the older mapping stays. "Whichever key comes first"
 * therefore returns the OLDEST session forever, and since the continuation
 * chain has moved on, every subsequent pull chain-mismatches and forks off
 * another fragment — a state `--force-append` cannot rescue, because force
 * never skips the chain guard. index-file.ts:30-41 refuses the mirror-image
 * shortcut in the forward direction for the same reason.
 *
 * So: the delta's anchor decides. The session whose head IS the entry this
 * continuation follows is the one it belongs on, whatever the map's insertion
 * order says — which is also what makes a poisoned map self-healing, since
 * the fragment that stranded the thread is exactly the session carrying the
 * anchor next time round.
 *
 * Order of preference:
 *   1. sessions whose head uuid equals `anchorUuid` (when it's known and any
 *      candidate matches) — otherwise every candidate stays in the running,
 *      so the caller still gets a sensible base to name in the decline;
 *   2. `preferred` (the session THIS pull already landed content in) if it
 *      survived step 1;
 *   3. most recent `lastActiveAt`, ties broken by lexically greatest session
 *      id — a strict total order, so the answer never depends on map or
 *      directory iteration order.
