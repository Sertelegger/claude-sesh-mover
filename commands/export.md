description: Export the current Claude Code session or all sessions for this project
---

You are running the sesh-mover export command. Follow these steps:

1. Detect the current session ID from the conversation context: look at the `sessionId` field in any recent tool result in this conversation. Do not use `sesh-mover browse` — it lists previously-exported bundles, not live sessions. If the session ID isn't obvious, list `<configDir>/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` and ask the user to pick.

2. Ask the user configuration questions using the AskUserQuestion tool to present selectable options. Ask one question at a time (unless the user has config defaults set, in which case skip those questions). The labels below are what the user sees; the `→` arrow shows which CLI flag value to pass in step 4.

   **Question 1 — Scope:**
   Use AskUserQuestion with options:
   - "This session only" (default/recommended) → `--scope current`
   - "All sessions in this project" → `--scope all`

   **Question 2 — Storage:**
   Use AskUserQuestion with options:
   - "User level (~/.claude-sesh-mover/)" (recommended) → `--storage user`
   - "Project level (.claude-sesh-mover/)" → `--storage project`

   **Question 3 — Format:**
   Use AskUserQuestion with options:
   - "Directory (recommended)" — inspectable, git-friendly → `--format dir`
   - "Archive (tar.gz)" — single portable file → `--format archive`
   - "Archive (tar.zst)" — faster compression, requires zstd → `--format zstd`

   **Question 4 — Layers:** (AskUserQuestion enforces `maxItems: 4`, so the three low-traffic auxiliary layers are grouped.)
   Use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect: true and options:
   - "Include everything (recommended)" → omit `--exclude`
   - "Exclude file-history" → add `file-history` to `--exclude`
   - "Exclude tool-results" → add `tool-results` to `--exclude`
   - "Exclude memory/plans/subagents" → add `memory plans subagents` to `--exclude`

   **Question 5 — Mode (only if prior peers exist for this project):**
   Read `~/.claude-sesh-mover/sync-state/<encoded-project-path>.json` if present. If the file is missing or `peers` is empty, skip this question entirely.

   If peers exist, ask with AskUserQuestion (≤4 options):
   - Slot 1: "Full export (every session)" → omit `--incremental`
   - Slots 2–3: one slot per known peer, up to two peers — "Incremental for peer `<name>`" → `--incremental --to <peer-id>`
   - Slot 4 (when peers.length ≤ 2): "Incremental since another export…" → prompt for path, add `--incremental --since <path>`
   - Slot 4 (when peers.length > 2): "Other…" → follow-up question listing the remaining peers and the `--since` option.

   Incremental composes with --scope. Default --scope to `all` when --incremental is selected unless the user picks "This session only".

   Only ask for individual exclusion of memory, plans, or subagents if the user explicitly requests that granularity after seeing the grouped option.

3. Generate a one-line summary of the session by reading the first few exchanges, then describe it in ~100 characters.

4. Run the CLI command, substituting the values mapped in the questions above:
   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/cli.js" export --scope <current|all> --session-id <id> --storage <user|project> --format <dir|archive|zstd> [--exclude <layer1> <layer2> ...] --name "<name>" --source-config-dir "<config-dir>"
   ```
   Never pass user-facing labels (e.g. `tar.zst`, `project`) as flag values — always pass the mapped CLI value (`zstd`, `all`, etc.). The CLI also accepts `tar.gz`/`tar.zst` as aliases for `archive`/`zstd`, but prefer the canonical values.

5. Parse the JSON output. If `collision` is true, use AskUserQuestion with options, then re-run the step 4 invocation with the corresponding flag appended:
   - "Keep both (append suffix)" — append `--suffix` and re-run
   - "Overwrite existing export" — append `--overwrite` and re-run
   - "Cancel" — stop, do not re-run

6. If archive was requested, the result's `archivePath` is the single artifact — the staging directory is removed automatically. Report `archivePath` as the destination; do not mention a separate directory.

7. Report what was exported: session name, summary, layers included, destination path.

**Invocation:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is set by Claude Code inside plugin command execution — use it as-is in the bash invocations above; do not search the plugin cache. The flag set documented in this file (in both the main invocation and any conditional/retry branches, e.g. `--suffix`/`--overwrite` for collision handling) is authoritative — do not run the CLI with `--help` or with no arguments to discover its surface.
